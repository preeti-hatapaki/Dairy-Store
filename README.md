# Dairy-Store


Dairy Product System
This Java application simulates a system for managing dairy products, allowing vendors to add products to their inventory, update quantities, and manage sales. Users can register, browse available products, add items to their cart, and complete purchases.

A] Features:


Vendor Features:
1. Register and login securely.
2. Add new products with details like name, quantity, price, and expiry date.
3. Update inventory quantities and manage product details.


User Features:
1. Register and login securely.
2. View available products from all registered vendors.
3. Add products to a shopping cart, specifying quantities.
4. Remove products from the cart and view the current cart contents.
5. Checkout the cart, view the total amount, and confirm the purchase.


B] How to Use:

Vendor Operations:
1. Register as a vendor or log in if already registered.
2. Add products to the inventory and update details as necessary.
3. View current inventory status and manage product availability.

User Operations:
1. Register as a user or log in if already registered.
2. Browse available products from all vendors.
3. Add desired products to the cart, specifying quantities.
4. Review and adjust cart contents before checkout.
5. Complete the purchase by confirming the total amount.

C] Technologies Used:

1. Java
2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles

   
D] Data Structures Used:

1. HashMaps: Used to store and manage vendors and users, facilitating quick access and authentication during login and registration processes.
   
2. ArrayLists: Employed for maintaining inventory lists and user shopping carts, supporting dynamic addition, removal, and display of products.
These data structures are chosen for their efficiency in managing and organizing data, ensuring smooth operation and scalability of the system.


E] Future Scope
Estimated Delivery Time
In future updates, we plan to implement a feature to estimate delivery times for orders placed by users. This enhancement aims to provide users with more transparency and convenience regarding when their dairy products will arrive. The estimated delivery time will be dynamically calculated based on factors such as product availability, vendor location, and user preferences.
